            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Greeshma Bodipudi" class="profile-pic">
            <p>Following the completion of my studies, my keen interest in pursuing a career in Information Technology led me to focus on learning MSBI (Microsoft Business Intelligence) and SQL. After persistent efforts, I successfully secured a position as an MSBI developer, where I dedicated three years to honing my skills in the field.



Subsequently, I got married and within a year my husband received an opportunity to work in Sydney, Australia. Embracing this new chapter, we relocated in 2019, drawn to the country's allure and aspiring to settle permanently. During this time, I took a career break to focus on family responsibilities, including the birth of my son.



Amidst this period, I recognized the importance of staying updated in the dynamic IT landscape. Motivated by my fascination with its capabilities, I undertook training in Salesforce, which reignited my professional aspirations. This decision prompted me to pursue Salesforce administration certification, enabling me to proactively seek new career opportunities.



In summary, my journey reflects a commitment to continuous learning and adaptation, balancing personal responsibilities with professional growth in pursuit of a fulfilling career in IT.</p>
