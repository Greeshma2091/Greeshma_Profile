            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Greeshma Bodipudi" class="profile-pic">
            <p>After completing my studies, I developed a strong interest in Information Technology, which led me to focus on Microsoft Business Intelligence (MSBI) and SQL. With determination and continuous learning, I secured a role as an MSBI developer. Over the next two years, I dedicated myself to refining my skills and making significant contributions in the field.</p> <br>

<p>In 2019, following my marriage, my husband received a job opportunity in Sydney, Australia. Embracing this new chapter, we relocated, and I decided to take a career break to prioritize family responsibilities, including the birth of my son.</p> <br>

<p>During this time, I recognized the importance of staying relevant in the ever-evolving IT industry. To ensure I continued to grow professionally, I undertook training in Salesforce, which reignited my passion for technology. I further pursued Salesforce administration certification and also dedicated time to enhance my coding skills by learning core Java programming. This combination of efforts has empowered me to proactively seek new career opportunities in the IT domain.</p> <br>

<p>In summary, my journey reflects a commitment to continuous learning and adaptation, balancing personal responsibilities with professional growth in pursuit of a fulfilling career in IT.</p> <br>
